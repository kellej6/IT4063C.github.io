      * what you are trying to do
      * what have you already tried
      * code snippet
        * a Screenshot may be acceptable. However, something we can copy-paste would be greatly appreciated (GitHub Gist or code sandbox)

## Coursework Submissions

### Quality Expectation 🏅
- Make sure to closely follow the instructions provided.
- Make sure to always review and adhere to the the [Code Style Guide](/guides/code-style) when working on your assignments

### Late Policy ⏳
* No late Quizzes will be accepted once the due date has passed.
* 20% of the assignment total would be deducted for every late day.
  * *i.e., 5 late days = 20% × 5 days = 0.*
* **However, ☝️** you have a total of **7 slip days** that you can apply to your semester's labs, and projects *(No Questions Asked)*.
  * No Single assignment can be extended more than 5 days.
  * You have to explicitly request that we use your slip days credit on an assignment on the Canvas Submission.

:::danger No Exceptions
or additional extensions will be given except for the two University-approved situations:
  * Accommodations requested and verified from the Office of Disability Services. 
  * Religious holidays, when I am notified of them in advance.

## Course Evaluation 👍
The School of Information Technology requires that each course is evaluated each time it is taught.  The School uses a confidential web-based system, CoursEval, for these evaluations.  At the beginning of finals week,you will receive an email from the School Head, with “CoursEval” as the topic.  There is a link on that email that takes you directly to the evaluation.  The online system is anonymous.  I will receive only a summary report of combined data after final grades have been submitted.

As an instructor, I greatly value your input regarding the strengths and areas for improvement of this course.  Your feedback is essential for me to continually improve instruction and provide for quality student learning and outcomes.

<!-- ## Assignment Submission Workflow and Expectations
- Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
  - this will copy the starter files for the assignment to a repository named as `<assignment name>-<your github username>`
- Clone down the project to your computer.
- start modifying/writing your code to satisfy the assignment requirements.
- Make sure you commit your code frequently and use a descriptive commit messages.
  - the best practice here is to commit at the end of every complete thought. (i.e. `modified the user class to validate the age input`, `updated the self assessment in the README file`)
- Once you're done with the assignment, confirm that you've updated the self evaluation and added any notes or reflections you had.
- Copy the Repository link and submit to Canvas.

**Remember to:** make sure your code is on GitHub and you didn't just commit it locally. -->
<!-- TODO: update the above, maybe make a guide about this -->
